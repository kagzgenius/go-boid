# Boids: simulating flocks in go


Developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, boids is an artificial life program that simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. The program runs in O(n^2) time complexity and has both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional variants. In this [post](https://kagzgenius.github.io/blog/boids-flight/), learn how to implement boids in 2 dimensions using go and the graphics package [ebiten](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2).
